# Fresh Tomatoes

Udacity Fresh Tomatoes movie trailer project. The Python application takes in a list of movie classes and generates a movie trailer webpage.

## Prerequisites

The program requires the following:

- Python 2.7.9+

## Application Files

Application files are as follows:

* movie.py
  - Movie class definition. Defines movie class attributes.
* fresh_tomatoes.py
  - Udacity supplied file. Used to generate the movie trailer webpage.
* entertainment_center.py
  - Program entry point. Moive classes are instantiated and listed here.

## Execution

All the application files need to be in the same folder.

Running the entertainment_center.py Python file from a Python shell or IDLE will generate a webpage of movie trailers from the movie classes listed in entertainment_center.py

The webpage should get generated in the same folder as the application files, and should be called fresh_tomatoes.html

Once the webpage is generated, it should automatically open in a new browser tab.
